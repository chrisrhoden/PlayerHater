# PlayerHater

PlayerHater is an Android library for playing audio in the background of your app. You can use it for:

* Podcasts!
* Music!
* Radio!

You probably shouldn't use it for:

* Fart sounds
* Game sound effects

There's a whole lot that PlayerHater does for you right out of the box and you can add your own functionality through the use of plugins. PlayerHater even ships with plugins that will do the following automatically:

* Show a regular notification on on Android 2.3 or lower, a notification with player controls on Android 3.0+, and an expandable notification on Android 4.2+!
* Handle audio focus changes in all of the weird and different ways for pre-2.2 and post-2.2 versions!
* Add lock screen controls on Android 4.0+!
* Pebble support!

All of this is configurable if you like, and you can write your own plugins to run alongside these.

But the best thing about PlayerHater is that there are no ServiceConnection callbacks, MediaPlayer state diagrams, or setup and teardown code for you to write. It's all taken care of in the library.

## Quick Start

### Important, temporary information

    Everything's going into Maven Central soon using the new aar format
    that's part of the new Android build system that uses Gradle. If
    you're not comfortable using the sonatpe OSS snapshot server (or if
    you don't know what that is) or you haven't moved to Gradle yet, you
    can check out the project repository and use the files in 

    legacyLibraryProject/PlayerHater

    as if they were a normal android library project. They are, in fact
    symlinks.

    Note that doing this will require you to add entries to your
    AndroidManifest.xml file, while the new build system allows us to
    automatically do this for you if you're using Gradle.

Once you've imported the project into your android application and added the `Service` and `BroadcastReceiver` to your `AndroidManifest.xml` file, getting a handle on the player is as easy as:

```java
import org.prx.android.playerhater.PlayerHater;

class MyApplicationActivity extends Activity {

	private PlayerHater mPlayerHater;

	@Override
	public void onResume(Bundle savedInstanceState) {
		super.onResume(savedInstanceState);
		mPlayerHater = PlayerHater.bind(this);
	}
	
	@Override
	public void onPause() {
		mPlayerHater.release();
	}

}
```

When you've bound to a `PlayerHater`, you're ready to start playing stuff - music, podcasts, or whatever new thing the kids are listening to these days.

## Changelog

### v0.3.0

We refactored everything to make more sense and run faster. Large parts of the codebase have been written from scratch using knowledge we gained in versions 0.1.0 and 0.2.0 and many class and method names have been changed to make more sense.

0.3.0 is a breaking upgrade from 0.2.0 and is still considered beta software until a 1.0.0 release.

#### Highlights

* The Service is now aggressively bound whenever you are interacting with PlayerHater. It's still released when appropriate so that Android can GC the process automatically and it will not show up in the Android Running Services list.

* getState() will now return one of `PlayerHater.IDLE`, `PlayerHater.PLAYING`, `PlayerHater.LOADING`, or `PlayerHater.PAUSED` instead of one of the lower-level MediaPlayer states.

* `public Bundle getExtra()` and `public String getAlbumTitle()` have been added to the `Song` interface. `void onAlbumTitleChanged(String albumTitle)` has been added to the `PlayerHaterPlugin` interface.

* `void onServiceStarted(IPlayerHaterBinder binder)` has been removed from the `PlayerHaterPlugin` interface. If you need access to Service-only methods, check to see if the `PlayerHater` passed to `onPlayerHaterLoaded()` is a `ServicePlayerHater`, cast, and then call the methods needed.

* Song data is loaded just in time, even across the IPC boundary. This means that if you enqueue a `Song` and then the return values for the various Song methods change, those changes will be propagated. Please note that if your Activity-side application is terminated the Song data will be serialized at that moment and passed across the barier to permit garbage collection.

### v0.2.0

* No service callbacks to deal with - Service is automatically started as needed when `play()` is called. You can immediately work with PlayerHater and all commands sent to it will be forwarded to the Service once it is started.

* It is no longer the developer's responsibility to remember when to and when not to stop the service.

* The service is now runnable on a separate Android process through the use of AIDL IPC.

* Too many changes to enumerate. Refer to documentation.

0.2.0 is a breaking upgrade from 0.1.0 and is still considered beta software until a 1.0.0 release.
